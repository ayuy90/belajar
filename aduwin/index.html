<p><strong>Aduwin</strong>. Alduin has laid some kind of soul-snare across the valley of Sovngarde a mist where he hides and feeds upon the trapped souls.

During the executions Alduin will be flying above Helgen and his roars can be faintly heard. Once the Last Dragonborn is placed on the chopping block he will land on top of the tower above and use the roar that summons a storm raining meteors down from the sky to cause havoc and destruction in the settlement.</p>
